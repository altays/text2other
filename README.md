To run, type "node app.js testFile.txt outfile -f=<m/w/j/g/r/b>". You will need NodeJS to run this.

This will use "testfile.txt" from the inputs folder as the source and save a new file starting with the name "outfile." The output file will be saved in the "outputs" folder separated by extension.

Currently supports creating wav files from any kind of input.

Future plans:
* implement support for mp3, raw, jpg, gif, bmp, and other formats
* utilities
* general github niceties
* clean up code
