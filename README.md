To run, type "node app.js inputs/testFile.txt outfile -f=<m/w/j/g/r/b>"

This will use "testfile.txt" from the inputs folder as the source and save a new file starting with the name "outfile"

Currently supports creating wav files from any kind of input.

Future plans:
* implement support for mp3, raw, jpg, gif, bmp, and other formats
* clean up code
* general github niceties
